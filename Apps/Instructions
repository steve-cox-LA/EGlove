The two aia files are for use and/or modification in MIT App Inventor.

  gaitMonitor.aia    works on its own, from the user's pocket
  GloveServer.aia    is designed to be used with GloveClient.ino    from the the ArduinoCode folder, running on the glove.

GloverServer.apk can be installed directly onto your Android phone.
