The two aia files are for use and/or modification in MIT App Inventor.

  gaitMonitor.aia    works on its own, processing acceleromtere data, from the user's pocket. 
  It scores the gait as the total variation of the fundamental frequency over 10 2-second epochs.

  GloveServer.aia    is designed to be used with GloveClient.ino    from the the ArduinoCode folder, 
  running on the glove. It permits the user to change the 3 key glove parameters:
  1) Motor Amplitude,
  2) Pattern Duration, and
  3) Burst Duration

GloverServer.apk can be installed directly onto your Android phone.

The Evoice.zip file contains the full Android Studio Project for recording voice and scoring 
jitter (the variation in pitch) and 
shimmer (the variation in amplitude)

Evoice.apk can be installed directly onto your Android phone.
