Espanola GloveWorks Designs, Codes, and Apps

The designs are
  - stl files for the finger pads, glove box, and box top
  - pcb files for the printed circuit board
  - patterns for the glove fabric

The arduino code for the glove exists in two versions
  - static (vibration pattern follows original Tass paper)
  - dynamic (vibration pattern parameters are adjustable via a BLE bluetooth app)

Additional app code is here for the
   - gait monitor, and
   - voice monitor, and
   - tapping monitor
